if profile not there -> fetch data to fill up

No currently - Future enhancement
in the search bar display peope and jobs. Keep a filter as rect
angular box, so that people can select 

Code starts here:
imissed how to find profile complete or incomplete status:
    def profile_status(self, request):

i understand if field s are missing, there should be edit button to display to edit fields.

not just error message with all fields. so mostly fetchstatus is not requrired

why two banners?
Dahboard componet
dashboard layout

call 2nd api -> fetsstatus in first api /dashboard-profile
const [status,setStats] = useSTate(null)

useEffect(() => {

if (!user) return;
const loadAll = async() => {
const profileData = await fetchDashboardByEmail(user.email)
setProfile(profileData);
};

loadAll();


}, [user]);


if(!profile) return <div> Loading...</div>







Feature: search bar in common. now - seperate for jobs and people
